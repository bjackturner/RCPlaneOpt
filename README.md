## RCPlaneOpt
A program designed to generate the most optimal plane for a given altitude, weight, internal volume, etc. The program can optimize for either endurance or range while ensuring that the final design adheres to the takeoff, interior volume, speed, and other constraints. This code is a personal project and is still a work in progress.
